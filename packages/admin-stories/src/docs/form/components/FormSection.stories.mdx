# FormSection

The FormSection is used to separate larger forms into smaller groups of inputs/fields that can be described with a title.<br/>
This should result in a less cluttered and easier to understand form.

## Props

| Name                | Type               | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| children\*          | `node`             |               | The form fields of the section.                                                                                                                                          |
| title               | `string` \| `node` |               | The title of the section.                                                                                                                                                |
| disableMarginBottom | `boolean`          | false         | Removes the `marginBottom` of the section. This is helpful, e.g. for the last FormSection inside a container where the spacing at the end of the form would be too much. |
| disableTypography   | `boolean`          | false         | Renders the title without `Typography`. This is helpful when a custom style is needed for the title.                                                                     |
