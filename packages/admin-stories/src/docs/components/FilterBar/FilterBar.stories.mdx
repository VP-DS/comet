# Filterbar

The Filterbar Component helps you create a horizontal orientated list of PopoverFields which can include all kind of sorts of Final Form Fields.
**The Filterbar only works inside of a Final Form.**

The Filterbar consists of four different components:

-   FilterBar
-   FilterBarPopoverFilter
-   FilterBarMoreFilters
-   FilterBarActiveFilterBadge

Every FilterBarPopoverFilter Component contains its own FinalForm which takes via initialValues the values from the wrapping form.
Due to the power of FinalForm, every FilterBarPopoverFilter form knows which values is theirs. On Submit of the FilterBarPopoverFilter form every value will be changed in the wrapping Form.
The wrapping form will rerender due to the change of values and the FilterBarPopoverFilter form will get new initialValues and knows which values needs to be mapped to their fields.

#### OnSubmit method of FilterBarPopoverFilter form

```
onSubmit={(values) => {
    for (const name in values) {
        outerForm.change(name, values[name]);
    }
}}
```

The FilterBarActiveFilterBadge shows the current count of set values of every FilterBarPopoverFilter form. This component so as the calculation can be overriden.
