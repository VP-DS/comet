# Router Tabs

The Comet Admin `RouterTabs` component has largely the same functionality as `Tabs`.
However, `RouterTabs` manages its state in the URL so that each tab has a unique URL.

`RouterTabs` has following props:

-   `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component. Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
-   `tabsProps` for passing props to [Material UI's `Tabs` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tabs/)

## RouterTabs and Stack

When used inside a `Stack`, `RouterTabs` may behave a little different.
If you nest multiple `StackSwitch` inside the same `Stack` and there are `RouterTabs` on each level,
only two `RouterTabs` are shown simultaneously at each point in time.
This ensures that the UI doesn't appear cluttered with tabs.
