# Router Tabs

The Comet Admin `RouterTabs` component has essentially the same functionality as `Tabs`.
However, `RouterTabs` manages its state in the URL so that each tab has a unique URL.

`RouterTabs` has the following props:

-   `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component. Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
-   `tabsProps` for passing props to [Material UI's `Tabs` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tabs/)

As children, an array of `RouterTab` elements should be passed to `RouterTabs`.
Each `RouterTab` needs:

-   a `label` that is shown in the tab bar
-   a unique `path` of the tab that is attached to the URL
-   optionally a `forceRender` flag.
    If set to `true`, the tab content is always rendered and only hidden via CSS while the tab is not active.
    The default value is `false`, meaning the content is only rendered if the tab is active.

## RouterTabs and Stack

When used inside a `Stack`, `RouterTabs` may behave a little differently.
If you nest multiple `StackSwitch` inside the same `Stack` and there are `RouterTabs` on each level,
only two `RouterTabs` are shown simultaneously at each point in time.
That ensures that the UI doesn't appear cluttered with tabs.
