The Comet Admin `Tabs` are based on [Material UI's `Tabs`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tabs/) (`MuiTabs`).

## Differences between Comet Admin `Tabs` and `MuiTabs`

Like all Material UI components, `MuiTabs` is relatively low-level.
It's very flexible but has no built-in functionality.
Comet Admin enhances the `MuiTabs` by adding built-in functionality.
Therefore, using Comet Admin `Tabs` is considerably easier and faster.

The following example shows the definition of simple tabs with `MuiTabs` and Comet Admin `Tabs`.

With `MuiTabs`, you have to manage the state yourself (`value`) and ensure that only the current tab's content is rendered.
You can use `MuiTabs` and `MuiTab` only for creating the tab labels.
The tab content has to be defined separately.

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        // based on https://v4.mui.com/components/tabs/#SimpleTabs.tsx
        const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);
        const handleChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<{}>, newValue: number) => {
            setValue(newValue);
        };
        return (
            <div>
                <MuiAppBar>
                    <MuiTabs value={value} onChange={handleChange}>
                        <MuiTab label="Label One" />
                        <MuiTab label="Label Two" />
                        <MuiTab label="Label Three" />
                    </MuiTabs>
                </MuiAppBar>
                <div hidden={value !== 0}>
                    {value === 0 && (
                        Content One
                    )}
                </div>
                <div hidden={value !== 1}>
                    {value === 1 && (
                        Content Two
                    )}
                </div>
                <div hidden={value !== 2}>
                    {value === 2 && (
                        Content Three
                    )}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
`}
/>

With Comet Admin `Tabs`, the state management and rendering logic are built-in.
And you can simply pass the tab content as child to the `Tab` component.

<Source
    language="tsx"
    code={dedent`
        <Tabs>
            <Tab label="Label One">
                Content One
            </Tab>
            <Tab label="Label Two">
                Content Two
            </Tab>
            <Tab label="Label Three">
                Content Three
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
`}
/>
