The Comet Admin `RouterTabs` are based on [Material UI's `Tabs`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tabs/).
The `RouterTabs` component manages its state in the URL so that each tab has a unique URL.

`RouterTabs` has following props:

-   `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component. Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
-   `tabsProps` for passing props to [Material UI's `Tabs` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tabs/)
