# Router Tabs

> Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

The Comet Admin `RouterTabs` are based on [Material UI's `Tabs`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tabs/).
The `RouterTabs` component manages its state in the URL so that each tab has a unique URL.

`RouterTabs` has following props:

-   `tabComponent` for passing a custom tab component. Per default, [Material UI's `Tab` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tab/) is used
-   `tabsProps` for passing props to [Material UI's `Tabs` component](https://v4.mui.com/api/tabs/)

## RouterTabs and Stack

When used inside a `Stack`, `RouterTabs` may behave a little different.
If you nest multiple `StackSwitch` inside the same `Stack` and there are `RouterTabs` on each level,
only two `RouterTabs` are shown simultaneously at each point in time.
This ensures that the UI doesn't appear cluttered with tabs.
