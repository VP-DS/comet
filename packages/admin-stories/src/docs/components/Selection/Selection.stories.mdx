# Selection

In Comet Admin, a _selection_ can be used to manage which item a user has currently selected.
It's most commonly used for keeping track of selections when combining a table and a form.

The selection API is used internally by the `EditDialog`.

## Selection

There are two ways to integrate a selection.

### useSelection() Hook (Recommended)

The `useSelection()` hook returns an array containing two objects.
The first object contains two values:

-   `id` holds the id of the currently selected item.
-   `mode` specifies the goal of the selection. Either `add` (add a new item) or `edit` (edit an existing item).

The second object is the SelectionApi. It provides three functions:

-   `handleSelectId()` for selecting an existing item
-   `handleAdd()` for adding a new item
-   `handleDeselect()` for deselection

### Selection Component

The `Selection` component passes its values to its children via child function.

It provides the same values as `useSelection()`, but the variable names are slightly different:

-   `selectedId` instead of `id`
-   `selectionMode` instead of `mode`
-   `selectionApi` contains the SelectionApi
