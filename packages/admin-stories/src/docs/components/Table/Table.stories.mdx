## Table

Table has three required parameters: `data`, `totalCount` and `columns`.

`data` contains the data that should be displayed in the table. It must be an array of objects and each object must have a unique `id`.

`totalCount` specifies the total number of items.
It's only relevant if pagination is used. Then, the totalCount should be provided by the API.
If **no pagination** is used, `totalCount` can simply be set to `data.length`.

`columns` is an array that defines the structure of the table. It specifies which columns exist and how to render them.

### Columns

The only required property of a column is its `name`.
Per default, the `name` is matched to a property of `data` which is then rendered (Column "ID" in the example above).
This also works for nested properties if the `name` is separated by dots (Column "Job" in the example above).

The default behavior can be overwritten by passing a function to the `render` prop (Column "Name" in the example above).
This can be used for altering the styling of a column or for rendering columns that don't have a corresponding prop in `data`.
