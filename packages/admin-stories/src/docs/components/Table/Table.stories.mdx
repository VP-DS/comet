## Table

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-table-basic-table--basic-table" />
</Canvas>

Table has three required parameters: `data`, `totalCount` and `columns`.

`data` contains the data that should be displayed in the table. It must be an array of objects and each object must have a unique `id`.

`totalCount` specifies the total number of items.
It's only relevant if pagination is used. Then, the totalCount should be provided by the API.
If **no pagination** is used, `totalCount` can simply be set to `data.length`.

`columns` is an array that defines the structure of the table.
It specifies which columns exist and how to render them.
More information can be found in the [section about columns](#columns).

## Columns

### Name

The only required property of a column is its `name`.
Per default, the `name` is matched to a property of `data` which is then rendered:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-table-table-props--table-name-prop" />
</Canvas>

This also works for nested properties if the `name` is separated by dots:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-table-table-props--table-nested-name-prop" />
</Canvas>

### Render

The default rendering behavior can be overwritten by passing a function to the `render` prop.
The render function can be used for altering the styling of a column or for rendering columns that don't have a corresponding prop in `data`:

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-table-table-props--table-render-prop" />
</Canvas>
