# Filterbar

The Filterbar Component helps you create a horizontal orientated list of PopoverFields which can include all kind of sorts of Final Form Fields.
The Intention of the Filterbar was to act as a Filter of a Table, which is also the main usecase for this Component.
**The Filterbar only works inside of a Final Form.**

The Filterbar consists of four different components:

-   FilterBar
-   FilterBarPopoverFilter
-   FilterBarMoreFilters
-   FilterBarActiveFilterBadge

## Table Example

<Canvas>
    <Story id="stories-components-table-filterbar-filterbar-default--default" />
</Canvas>

## Advanced Informations

Every FilterBarPopoverFilter Component contains its own FinalForm. So the Filterbar is kinda like a collection of final forms, which pass their values into a wrapping form.

#### OnSubmit method of FilterBarPopoverFilter form

```
onSubmit={(values) => {
    for (const name in values) {
        outerForm.change(name, values[name]);
    }
}}
```

The FilterBarActiveFilterBadge shows the current count of set values of every FilterBarPopoverFilter form. This componentas well as the calculation can be overritten.
