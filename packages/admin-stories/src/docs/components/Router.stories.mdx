# Router

Comet Admin makes use of [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/web) and extends it.

## `BrowserRouter`

Use this component just like from react-router.

It provides the following additions to react-router:

-   shows a confirmation dialog as mui Dialog
-   supports multiple `Prompt`s

## `RouterPrompt`

Similar to react-router `Prompt`, supports multiple instances.

#### Props

Compared to react-router, it does only support the [function usage method](https://reactrouter.com/core/api/Prompt/message-func)
